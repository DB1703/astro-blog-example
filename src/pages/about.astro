          I'm {identity.firstName}, I live in {identity.country} and this is my blog.
          I thought the idea of making blogs was almost gone but it seems that <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://astro.build">Astro</a
          >
          and it's superpowers it is bringing in back to life. I built this blog because
          I want to learn more about this awesome web framework and it's super capabilities.
          So I think you would found some really good news or is it blogs? I don't know,
          but I really hope this project help you to learn more about Astro as I am doing.
