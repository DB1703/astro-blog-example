      I'm {identity.firstName}, I live in {identity.country} and this is my blog. I thought the idea of making
      blogs was almost gone but it seems that <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://astro.build">Astro</a
      >
      and it's superpowers it is bringing in back to life. I built this blog because
      I want to learn more about this awesome web framework and it's super capabilities.
      So I think you would found some really good news or is it blogs? I don't know,
      but I really hope this project help you to learn more about Astro as I am doing.
