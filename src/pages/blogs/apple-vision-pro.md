# Are the Apple Vision Pro reinventing the VR world?

No controls/joysticks and a User Interface that integrates with the real enviroment. Vision Pro here we go.

## The idea of Spatial computing

A UI that integrates with the physical surroundings, more sensors than ever, and take control of the system with just your hands.
‚ÄúCreating our first spatial computer required invention across nearly every facet of the system,‚Äù said Mike Rockwell, Apple‚Äôs vice president of the Technology Development Group.
Also it has support for game controllers, I'm sure about the dualshock 4 and DualSense 5 from Playstation, but not from the Xbox ones. Keyboards, trackpads and mouse obviusly can be used to, at least the Apple ones.

Personally I think that this is a huge step up for the VR world, because, honestly it was only been used for games (something that I really love), Meta was getting closer to this idea of a Personal Computer with their Meta Quest and their metaverse. But there is not any VR headset with this implementation.

### Your hands, eyes, and voice are the steering wheel of the system.

The system tracks your eyes to know in wich part you are focusing on, an also looks for gestures in your hands to move and interact. Just imagine that basically you are thinking where do you wanna go, or what you wanna do, and the system can track you naturally and follow your instincts. This is the sweet spot that's been sought in computing in general, I mean in terms of User Experience.
Mark Zuckerbeg said recently that in Meta they were working to implement hand gestures, really happy to hear about this, more competence, better products.

## There¬¥s a long way to go

I am not fully agree to go out to the street and use a VR headset, because for me they are still really big devices, I think that the next step is longer battery in smaller headsets. And only one device for all the concepts out there, PC's, smartphones, smartwatches, etc.
We have seen in history that the All in One concept is the way to go.

I know that this blog may feel short, but I am getting used to writing, hope you like it anyway. See you in the next one üòâ
